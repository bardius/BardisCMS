### Features

* **Progressive enhancement**: Infinite AJAX Scroll works by enhancing your server-side pagination with AJAX. When a client doesn't support JavaScript it will fall back on your server-side pagination.
* **Extensible** through extensions.
* **Quick and easy to implement** because it extends your already existing server-side pagination (takes less then 5 minutes to implement)
